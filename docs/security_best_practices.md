# CyberLure Honeypot Security Best Practices

## **Introduction**
CyberLure is a high-interaction honeypot designed to analyze and mitigate cyber threats effectively. To ensure the security and integrity of the system, it is essential to follow best practices in deployment, configuration, and maintenance.

---

## **1. Deployment Security**
- **Isolated Environment:** Deploy CyberLure on a dedicated virtual machine or container to prevent actual system compromise.
- **Network Segmentation:** Use VLANs or a DMZ to separate honeypot traffic from critical network infrastructure.
- **Restricted Access:** Limit SSH access to trusted administrators using firewall rules and key-based authentication.

---

## **2. Configuration Hardening**
- **Honeypot Service Protection:**
  - Avoid exposing real system credentials in honeypot responses.
  - Configure Cowrie and Dionaea to simulate vulnerabilities without real exploitability.
- **Logging Encryption:**
  - Encrypt all logs before storage to prevent tampering or unauthorized access.
  - Use TLS/SSL for secure communication between honeypot and Splunk/ELK.
- **Minimal Exposure:**
  - Run only necessary services on the honeypot system.
  - Disable unnecessary ports and limit open ports to only those required for logging attacks.

---

## **3. Monitoring & Alerting**
- **Anomaly Detection:** Utilize Suricata IDS for real-time threat detection and trigger alerts for unusual patterns.
- **Automated Alerting:**
  - Configure email, Telegram, or webhook notifications for detected attacks.
  - Set up Splunk alert thresholds to avoid alert fatigue.
- **Threat Intelligence Integration:** Regularly update malicious IP feeds from sources like AbuseIPDB, AlienVault, and FireHOL.

---

## **4. Log Management & Analysis**
- **Centralized Logging:** Use a dedicated Splunk/ELK server for log storage and analysis.
- **Log Rotation:**
  - Implement log rotation policies to avoid excessive disk usage.
  - Archive older logs securely in an offline storage.
- **Forensic Analysis:**
  - Store honeypot logs in a forensically sound manner to aid investigation.
  - Hash and timestamp logs to ensure integrity.

---

## **5. Security Updates & Maintenance**
- **Regular Updates:**
  - Keep all honeypot services (Cowrie, Dionaea, Suricata) up to date with the latest patches.
  - Regularly update signature files for Suricata and malware definitions for Dionaea.
- **Access Controls:**
  - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Splunk and administrative access.
  - Implement strict user role management to prevent unauthorized modifications.
- **Automated Backup:**
  - Schedule periodic backups of logs and configurations.
  - Store backups in a secure, encrypted location.

---

## **6. Risk Mitigation Strategies**
- **Decoy Data Management:** Ensure that no real sensitive data is stored within the honeypot.
- **Response Plan:**
  - Have an incident response plan in place for honeypot breaches.
  - Use findings from the honeypot to strengthen overall network security.
- **Ethical Considerations:**
  - Ensure honeypots comply with legal and ethical guidelines.
  - Avoid engaging or retaliating against attackers directly.

---

## **Conclusion**
Following these best practices ensures that CyberLure remains an effective cybersecurity tool while minimizing risks. Regular maintenance, strict access controls, and advanced monitoring mechanisms are key to a successful honeypot deployment.
